# What is the PRD ?

A product requirements document (PRD) outlines the requirements and functionality of the product youâ€™re going to build so that your **_development team_** understands what they're building, who it's for, and the purpose it will serve for its end users.<br/>

# What Is The ERD ?

An engineering requirements document (ERD) is a statement describing the goal and purpose of a new component. **_Unlike a product requirements document (PRD), which tells engineers what they need to build, an ERD specifies why a part is being built and how its design fuels its purpose._** By following the engineering requirements outlined in an ERD, engineers can ensure that the part they build will satisfy customer needs.<br/>
